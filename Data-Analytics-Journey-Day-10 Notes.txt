Machine Learning for Data Analytics (10+ Lessons):
==================================================

1. Introduction to Machine Learning for Analytics:
==================================================
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI where systems learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.
In analytics, ML is used to uncover insights, make predictions, and automate decision-making.

Supervised Learning → Trained with labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).

Unsupervised Learning → Works on unlabeled data to find patterns (e.g., customer segmentation).


2. Linear Regression Basics:
============================
A statistical method for predicting a continuous value (like sales, temperature, or revenue).

Formula: y = m*x + c

Example: Predicting next month’s sales based on past data.

Output: A straight-line relationship between independent and dependent variables.


3. Logistic Regression:
=======================
Used for classification problems where the output is categorical (Yes/No, True/False).

Example: Will a customer churn? (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

Works by applying a sigmoid function to produce probabilities.


4. Decision Trees:
==================
A flowchart-like structure where each decision splits the data based on conditions.

Example: Predicting if a loan should be approved based on income, credit score, etc.

Pros: Easy to understand, works for both classification and regression.


5. Random Forests:
===================
An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for more accurate predictions.

Example: Predicting employee attrition using 100 different trees.

Benefits: Reduces overfitting, improves accuracy.


6. K-Means Clustering:
====================
An unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters.

Example: Grouping customers into buying behavior categories.

Works by finding centroids and assigning points to the nearest one.


7. Model Evaluation Metrics:
==========================
After building a model, you must measure its performance:

Accuracy → Correct predictions / Total predictions.

Precision & Recall → Important for imbalanced datasets.

F1-Score → Balance between precision & recall.

ROC Curve → Visualizing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.


8. Overfitting & Underfitting:
============================
Overfitting → Model learns noise, performs well on training data but fails on new data.

Underfitting → Model is too simple and can’t capture patterns.

Solutions: Cross-validation, regularization, pruning.


9. Feature Engineering:
=====================
Creating new, meaningful input variables to improve model performance.

Example: Extracting "Day of Week" from a date column to help predict sales patterns.

Includes: Encoding categorical data, scaling, and creating interaction features.


10. Case Study – Predicting Customer Churn:
=======================================
A complete mini-project:

Data: Customer demographics, purchase history, support tickets.

Goal: Predict if a customer will leave.

Steps: Data cleaning → Feature selection → Model building → Evaluation → Deployment.


11. Model Deployment Basics:
==========================
Once trained, models can be integrated into web apps, dashboards, or APIs.

Tools: Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit.

Example: A web form where you input customer details and get churn prediction instantly.


12. Intro to AutoML:
==================
Automated Machine Learning tools can build models with minimal coding:

Examples: Google AutoML, H2O.ai, Azure ML.

Benefits: Saves time, finds optimal algorithms automatically.
